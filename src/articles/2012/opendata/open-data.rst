.. epigraph::

    Open data is about public bodies publishing and freely licensing the
    non-personal data for which they are responsible in standard, machine-readable
    formats so that it may be consumed electronically either for commercial or
    non-commercial ends.

There has been a growing awareness of open data principles in recent years and an
appreciation of the economic benefits that might be had by enforcing those
principles. The vice-president of the European Commission Neelie Kroes,
while launching the `Open Data Strategy for Europe`_, points out the basic fact that
taxpayers have paid for the information to be collected and therefore they should
not be restricted in there ability to access it. She goes on to propose:

+ Making it a general rule that all documents made accessible by public sector
  bodies can be re-used for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, unless
  protected by third party copyright;
+ Establishing the principle that public bodies should not be allowed to charge
  more than costs triggered by the individual request for data (marginal costs);
  in practice this means most data will be offered for free or virtually for
  free, unless duly justified.
+ Making it compulsory to provide data in commonly-used, machine-readable
  formats, to ensure data can be effectively re-used.
+ Introducing regulatory oversight to enforce these principles;


Open Data - GB
==============

In the same document, the United Kingdom is held up as an exemplar of an
open-data-aware state with some substantial initiatives under way.
Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt, `in a co-authored article in The Times`_,
write about how they had looked forward to

.. epigraph::

    ...a world in which if you typed your postcode into a government website
    you would get all sorts of data. You would see the crime rate for your
    neighbourhood, when the buses ran and the rubbish was collected, how the
    schools were doing and what your local authority spends.

and then go on to say how this world has been realised with the central
government site `data.gov.uk`_

But it should be pointed out that `data.gov.uk`_ is primarily British (and in
fact English) in scope. Coverage is actually variable in the non-English regions
and, in the case of Northern Ireland in particular, none of the Police,
Health, Schools, or Roads data sets extend to Northern Irish postal districts.


Public Transport
----------------

In the Cabinet Office document
`Further Detail on Open Data Measures in the Autumn Statement 2011`_
there is the following resolution:

.. epigraph::

    3. Train and bus data - The Government will
       work with the transport industry to make
       available by April 2012 timetable and real-time
       train and bus information to support the
       development of innovative applications to
       improve passenger journeys.

And the specific data sets to be made available are given as:

+ Real-time running data from Network Rail
+ Location data about Great Britain Rail network
+ Location data about GB rail network stations
+ Traveline National Dataset on a weekly basis (Great Britain buses); and
+ Next Buses API of planned and real-time information at 350,000 GB bus stops (April 2012)

Again, no mention of N.I. or `Translink`_.
