    **Update May 2016:** This is a heavily edited version of a post from a short-lived
    blog I had a few years ago. The complaint about Northern Ireland's absence from the
    data sets on `data.gov.uk`_ has been somewhat redressed since this post was first
    published, but there are still some issues.  Yes, there is now more N.I. data
    available via the site, but there still seems to be a question over what data is
    *said* to be available, and what data is *actually* available.
    On the one hand, there is a range of files published by `belfast city council`_ and
    `opendatani`_ in multiple formats (including `a list of bus stops with coordinates`_!).
    So that's good.  But other publishers really don't provide anything useful - the seven
    data sets supposedly made available by the `PSNI`_ have urls which redirect to their
    website's front page! Not cool. And the 587 alleged data sets from
    `Northern Ireland Spatial Data Infrastructure`_ appear to be garbage unfortunately.
    But still, overall a positive development.

.. epigraph::

    Open data is about public bodies publishing and freely licensing the
    non-personal data for which they are responsible in standard, machine-readable
    formats so that it may be consumed electronically either for commercial or
    non-commercial ends.

There has been a growing awareness of `open data principles`_ in recent years and an
appreciation of the social and economic benefits that might be had by enforcing those
principles. The vice-president of the European Commission Neelie Kroes, launching the
`Open Data Strategy for Europe`_, highlighted the basic fact that taxpayers have paid
for the information to be collected and therefore they should not be restricted in
their ability to access it. She proposed:

+ Making it a general rule that all documents made accessible by public sector
  bodies can be re-used for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, unless
  protected by third party copyright;
+ Establishing the principle that public bodies should not be allowed to charge
  more than costs triggered by the individual request for data (marginal costs);
  in practice this means most data will be offered for free or virtually for
  free, unless duly justified.
+ Making it compulsory to provide data in commonly-used, machine-readable
  formats, to ensure data can be effectively re-used.
+ Introducing regulatory oversight to enforce these principles;


Open Data - GB
==============

In the same document, the United Kingdom is held up as an open-data-aware state
with some substantial initiatives under way.  Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt
co-authored `an article in The Times`_ where they write about how they had looked
forward to

.. epigraph::

    ...a world in which if you typed your postcode into a government website
    you would get all sorts of data. You would see the crime rate for your
    neighbourhood, when the buses ran and the rubbish was collected, how the
    schools were doing and what your local authority spends.

and then go on to say how this world has been realised with the central
government site `data.gov.uk`_

But although `data.gov.uk`_ is a welcome development, it should be pointed out that
it is primarily British (and in fact English) in scope. Coverage seems to be variable
in the non-English regions and, in the case of Northern Ireland in particular, none
of the Police, Health, Schools or Roads data sets extend to Northern Irish postal
districts.


Public Transport
----------------

In the Cabinet Office document
`Further Detail on Open Data Measures in the Autumn Statement 2011`_
there is the following resolution:

.. epigraph::

    3. Train and bus data - The Government will
       work with the transport industry to make
       available by April 2012 timetable and real-time
       train and bus information to support the
       development of innovative applications to
       improve passenger journeys.

And the specific data sets to be made available are given as:

+ Real-time running data from Network Rail
+ Location data about Great Britain Rail network
+ Location data about GB rail network stations
+ Traveline National Dataset on a weekly basis (Great Britain buses); and
+ Next Buses API of planned and real-time information at 350,000 GB bus stops (April 2012)

Again, no mention of N.I. or `Translink`_.

A Freedom of Information request `was recently made to Translink`_ for bus stop location
data, but it was refused.

Culture Change
==============

You can understand political hesitancy and bureaucratic inertia when it comes to
releasing public sector data in Northern Ireland, but it is a worthwhile effort
to promote cultural change in this area. Open data should ultimately be the
*object* of data collection rather than an auxiliary chore.
